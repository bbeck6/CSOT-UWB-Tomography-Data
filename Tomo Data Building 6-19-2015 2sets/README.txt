Hopefully final artificial building dataset. 4 stationary nodes: bots 0-3 in the corners of the map.  the other bots did the "merry go round" around the image.  Due to a server error we had to restart, hence the data is divided into 2 sets, but the second picks up where the first left off.
The object in the middle of the building is one of the SHORt cubicle walls with the RF foam.  Also, RF foam was placed all the way around the inside of the structure to add opacity.
See the photographs for the exact test layout.
The MERGED folder contains the same data as sets 1 and 2, joined to form a single data set.
