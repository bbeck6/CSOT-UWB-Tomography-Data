Test date: 4-3-2015
Location: 250 14th st. Conference Center 
Setup: This setup and data is intended to be used for the final demo, to generate the tomo images. The 2 barriers (4ft and 8ft) were placed at angles as required by the demo.  The data is collected in a concentrated fashion around the barriers, with the intent of filling in the "empty space" in the image reconstruction later. See Images for setup information.
